Design:
	This project doesn't appear to need too much new code, mostly just
	utilzing methods that are already written in both the formula and the
	Resources folder (formula and dependecy graph).
	To set up the project, a cell object looks to be useful to contain information
	such as the contents of the cell and the name. However, it may be simple enough that
	a new object may not be needed. A HashSet or Dictionary seems to be a good structure
	to hold cells in. The dependency graph can be easily used to hold all of the connections.
